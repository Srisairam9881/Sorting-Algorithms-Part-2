<b>Merge Sort :-</b>
* Merge Sort Algorithm is a Divide & Conquer algorithm. It divides input array in two halves, calls itself for the two halves(recursively) and then merges the two sorted halves. A separate merge() function is used for merging two halves. Merge sort is one of the most efficient sorting algorithms.
